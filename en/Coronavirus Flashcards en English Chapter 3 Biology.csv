Introduction to Chapter 3 Biology (Coronavirus Flashcards)|This chapter contains content to do with Biology and viruses
What is Biology? (Coronavirus Flashcards)|Biology is the study of living things
What makes a Virus different to Bacteria? (Coronavirus Flashcards)|They are usually much smaller and can only replicate inside the living cell of another living thing
Why do we no longer name a virus based on the geographic location of where it was found? (Coronavirus Flashcards)|Generally speaking an outbreak can occur anywhere in the world and sometimes there is inappropriate prejudice against people from this area so not naming it based on the location helps, also viruses don't respect geographic boundaries so there's not much information that can be gleamed from a location-based name
Why do we no longer name a virus based on the species of animal that it came from if it was a zoonotic transmission? (Coronavirus Flashcards)|Having an animal-based name doesn't tell you much about the virus so choosing a name which is more scientifically descriptive is more helpful
Are viruses considered as living organisms? (Coronavirus Flashcards)|This is a large debate in the scientific community as it does exhibit some signs of life but lacks others
What is the process that viruses use to replicate? (Coronavirus Flashcards)|They tend to hijack a cell to reproduce it's own viral DNA, this is usually done in a six stage replication cycle
What is the usual size of a virus? (Coronavirus Flashcards)|Most viruses that have been studied have a diameter between 20 & 300 nanometres but can be smaller or larger
How do viruses cause infections? (Coronavirus Flashcards)|TODO
How are viruses classified? (Coronavirus Flashcards)|Classification is an attempt to group similar species together and for viruses there is the ICTV classification system & the Baltimore classification system
Can viruses be seen under a microscope? (Coronavirus Flashcards)|Viruses are usually too small to be seen under an optical microscope but there are some kinds of microscopes that can also be used
