What makes a Virus different to Bacteria? (Coronavirus Flashcards)|TODO
Why do we no longer name a virus based on the geographic location of where it was found? (Coronavirus Flashcards)|Generally speaking an outbreak can occur anywhere in the world and sometimes there is inappropriate prejudice against people from this area so not naming it based on the location helps, also viruses don't respect geographic boundaries so there's not much information that can be gleamed from a location-based name
Why do we no longer name a virus based on the species of animal that it came from if it was a zoonotic transmission? (Coronavirus Flashcards)|Having an animal-based name doesn't tell you much about the virus so choosing a name which is more scientifically descriptive is more helpful
