Introduction to Chapter 4 Medicine (Coronavirus Flashcards)|This chapter contains content to do with Medicine and viruses
Why is it important to know about the field of medicine to do with viruses? (Coronavirus Flashcards)|It is important because these are the methods that are used to treat and cure people when they are infected, knowing these will allow you to avoid false claims and potentially dangerous or lethal pseudo science
What are common ways for testing if someone is infected? (Coronavirus Flashcards)|Depending on the type of disease you need to take a different kind of biological sample such as blood work, nasal swabs stool samples etc, it can then be used in a rapid test such as a strip test, you can use PCR or sequence it directly, each of these provide different benefits such as speed and accuracy
What are the ways to test if someone has immunity to a disease? (Coronavirus Flashcards)|Usually you take a blood sample and look if the antibodies for the virus is present
How do vaccines work? (Coronavirus Flashcards)|They provide a way for the immune system to generate antibodies without needing to be exposed to a fully activated form of the virus
What is the process for testing the efficacy of a vaccine? (Coronavirus Flashcards)|This is to test how well a vaccine reduces a disease in comparison to a non-vaccinated group, it is a very specific formula which can be written on a napkin
How are vaccines commonly verified as safe to be used? (Coronavirus Flashcards)|There are various stages of testing safety which usually ends in data which is publicly released for analysis and then governmental departments must approve it for use before it can be administered in a country
How does an immune system tackle an infection due to a virus? (Coronavirus Flashcards)|An immune system generates something called antibodies which attaches to a part of the virus called the antigen and renders it ineffective
What are the common forms of sterilisation of equipment in a medical setting? (Coronavirus Flashcards)|Steam sterilisation can be used on materials with high melting temperatures and don't degrade with moisture in devices such as autoclaves, other methods such as immersion in vaporized hydrogen peroxide, peracetic acid immersion or ozone can be used for other materials
What are some of the ways that medical equipment is safely disposed of when it can't be reused? (Coronavirus Flashcards)|There are various regulations depending on the type of equipment and materials used in the equipment (sharps, biohazard, pharmaceutical, radiological etc) but it usually goes in the steps of collecting, storing/transporting, treatment & disposal where treatment can be incineration, thermal (non-destructive such as autoclaving), irradiation (using microwaves) and chemical
What is emergency medicine? (Coronavirus Flashcards)|Emergency medicine can either mean medicine that is applied in an emergency (think A&E) or medicine when applied in a situation where the standard equipment is not available
