Introduction to Chapter 5 Mathematics (Coronavirus Flashcards)|This chapter contains content to do with the mathematics of viruses and epidemiology
Why is Mathematical Modelling so important? (Coronavirus Flashcards)|It is another way to find potential solutions with little to no resources
What are the common mathematical models for epidemics? (Coronavirus Flashcards)|Models for epidemics can be split into various categories such as Stochastic or Deterministic, agent based or compartmental models but the one that is usually taught first is the SIR model
What is the SIR Model? (Coronavirus Flashcards)|It's a compartmental model which splits the population into 3 compartments with specific formulae for how the population can change between different compartments; Susceptible (the part of the population who can catch the infection but haven't yet), Infected and Removed (can mean recovered or are now deceased so are no longer in the model)
What are some common modifications to the SIR model? (Coronavirus Flashcards)|Some other models differentiates between deceased and recovered populations, some allow for those who were recovered to become susceptible again, some split when someone is exposed and when they become infectious but there are many more things you can do given that there are many other variations with different acronyms (SIS, SIRD, MSIR, SEIR, SEIS, MSEIR, MSEIRS etc.)
What is the difference between a Agent-based models (ABM) and compartmental models? (Coronavirus Flashcards)|An agent based model is a type of compartmental model where each person/organisation is an autonomous unit, where compartmental models more generally are when a population is split into different compartments where people can transition between compartments
What is the difference between a Stochastic and Deterministic Model? (Coronavirus Flashcards)|A Stochastic model has some randomness explicitly designed into the model where a Deterministic model will always have the same output if given the same inputs
How can mathematical modelling be used to help model the effects of vaccination on a population? (Coronavirus Flashcards)|It can help mathematically test different roll-out strategies to maximise use of the vaccine
Why do assumptions play a crucial role in the mathematical modelling of the spread of a disease? (Coronavirus Flashcards)|Assumptions are usually the foundation of any model so if any of the assumptions are incorrect or not appropriate it will mean that some or all of the results may not be valid to draw conclusions from
What can we learn, even from overly simplistic, mathematical models of the spread of diseases? (Coronavirus Flashcards)|TODO
What are the benefits of computational based models? (Coronavirus Flashcards)|You're able to test various assumptions empirically in parallel to computationally brute force best parameters for a model
