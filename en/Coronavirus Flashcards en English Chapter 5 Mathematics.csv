Introduction to Chapter 5 Mathematics (Coronavirus Flashcards)|This chapter contains content to do with the mathematics of viruses and epidemiology
Why is Mathematical Modelling so important? (Coronavirus Flashcards)|It is another way to find potential solutions with little to no resources
What are the common mathematical models for epidemics? (Coronavirus Flashcards)|TODO
What is the SIR Model? (Coronavirus Flashcards)|TODO
What are some common modifications to the SIR model? (Coronavirus Flashcards)|TODO
What is the difference between a Agent-based models (ABM) and compartmental models? (Coronavirus Flashcards)|TODO
What is the difference between a Stochastic and Deterministic Model? (Coronavirus Flashcards)|A Stochastic model has some randomness explicitly designed into the model where a Deterministic model will always have the same output if given the same inputs
How can mathematical modelling be used to help model the effects of vaccination on a population? (Coronavirus Flashcards)|It can help mathematically test different roll-out strategies to maximise use of the vaccine
Why do assumptions play a crucial role in the mathematical modelling of the spread of a disease? (Coronavirus Flashcards)|Assumptions are usually the foundation of any model so if any of the assumptions are incorrect or not appropriate it will mean that some or all of the results may not be valid to draw conclusions from
What can we learn, even from overly simplistic, mathematical models of the spread of diseases? (Coronavirus Flashcards)|TODO
What are the benefits of computational based models? (Coronavirus Flashcards)|You're able to test various assumptions empirically in parallel to computationally brute force best parameters for a model
